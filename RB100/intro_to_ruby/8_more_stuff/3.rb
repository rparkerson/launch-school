# What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

# exception handling addresses issues or errors that arise when an
# exceptional condition occurs.  This allows for debugging and using the
# stack trace to follow the Call stack and locate where the exception was
# raised.

# from book
# Exception handling is a structure used to handle the possibility of an
# error occurring in a program. It is a way of handling the error by 
# changing the flow of control without exiting the program entirely.
