Complete the Program - Cats!

Consider the following program.

class Pet
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end
end

class Cat < Pet
end

pudding = Cat.new('Pudding', 7, 'black and white')
butterscotch = Cat.new('Butterscotch', 10, 'tan and white')
puts pudding, butterscotch

Update this code so that when you run it, you see the following output:

My cat Pudding is 7 years old and has black and white fur.
My cat Butterscotch is 10 years old and has tan and white fur.
=end

class Pet
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end
end

class Cat < Pet
  def initialize(name, age, color)
    super(name, age)
    @color = color
  end

  def to_s
    "My cat #{@name} is #{@age} years old and has #{@color} fur."
  end
end

pudding = Cat.new('Pudding', 7, 'black and white')
butterscotch = Cat.new('Butterscotch', 10, 'tan and white')
puts pudding, butterscotch

# My cat Pudding is 7 years old and has black and white fur.
# My cat Butterscotch is 10 years old and has tan and white fur.

class Pet
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end
end

class Cat < Pet
  def initialize(name, age, color)
    super(name, age)
    @color = color
  end

  def to_s
    "My cat #{name} is #{age} years old and has #{color} fur."
  end

  private

  attr_reader :name, :age, :color
end

pudding = Cat.new('Pudding', 7, 'black and white')
butterscotch = Cat.new('Butterscotch', 10, 'tan and white')
puts pudding, butterscotch

# My cat Pudding is 7 years old and has black and white fur.
# My cat Butterscotch is 10 years old and has tan and white fur.

Further Exploration

An alternative approach to this problem would be to modify the Pet class to
accept a colors parameter. If we did this, we wouldn't need to supply an
initialize method for Cat.

Why would we be able to omit the initialize method? Would it be a good idea
to modify Pet in this way? Why or why not? How might you deal with some of
the problems, if any, that might arise from modifying Pet?

We could omit the initialize method from Cat because it inherits from the
Pet superclass and has access to that initialize method. If pet was modified
in this way then all the other sub-classes of Pet might be affected by this
and depending on the implementation that could make a useless instance
variable. You could deal with some of these by creating a default paramenter
value of nil in case the other sub-class had only 2 arguments passed in.

# example from Further Exploration:
class Pet
  def initialize(name, age, color = nil)
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @color = color
  end
end

class Cat < Pet
  def to_s
    "My cat #{@name} is #{@age} years old and has #{@color} fur."
  end
end

pudding = Cat.new('Pudding', 7, 'black and white')
butterscotch = Cat.new('Butterscotch', 10, 'tan and white')
puts pudding, butterscotch

# My cat Pudding is 7 years old and has black and white fur.
# My cat Butterscotch is 10 years old and has tan and white fur.
