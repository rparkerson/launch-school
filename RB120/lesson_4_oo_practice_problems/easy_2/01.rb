Question 1

You are given the following code:

class Oracle
  def predict_the_future
    "You will " + choices.sample
  end

  def choices
    ["eat a nice lunch", "take a nap soon", "stay at work late"]
  end
end

What is the result of executing the following code:

oracle = Oracle.new
oracle.predict_the_future

This code creates a new instance object and calls the instance
method predict_the_future, returns a string concatinated with a 
random array element of the choices method array.
=end

class Oracle
  def predict_the_future
    "You will " + choices.sample
  end

  def choices
    ["eat a nice lunch", "take a nap soon", "stay at work late"]
  end
end

oracle = Oracle.new
p oracle.predict_the_future 
# => "eat a nice lunch" (or one of the array elements)
