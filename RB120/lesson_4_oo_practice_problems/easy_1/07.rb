Question 7
What is the default return value of to_s when invoked on an object?
Where could you go to find out if you want to be sure?

The default return value is the name of the objects class and encoded object id
number expressed as a string.
This could be found in the documentation of `to_s` in the Object class which
is in the method lookup path almost all classes.
