Card Deck
We started working on a card game but got stuck. Check out why the code
below raises a TypeError.

Once you get the program to run and produce a sum, you might notice that
the sum is off: It's lower than it should be. Why is that?

deck.keys.each do |suit|

puts(sum == total_sum - player_sum) #=> false
