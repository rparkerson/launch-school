Valid Series?
The valid_series? method checks whether a series of numbers is valid. For the
purposes of this exercise, a valid series of numbers must contain exactly
three odd numbers. Additionally, the numbers in the series must sum to 47.

Unfortunately, our last test case is not returning the expected result. Why
is that?

The check if the series sum is 47 is working properly. On `line 5` the
expression in the ternary is not a comparison but assignment. Since assignment
returns the object being assigned, `3`, and the integer 3 has a truthy value, this
ternary operator always executes the code right of the `?` which returns the 
boolean `true`.

This can be fixed by adding an `=` to make this a comparison expression
=end
def valid_series?(nums)
  return false if nums.sum != 47

  odd_count = nums.count { |n| n.odd? }
  odd_count = 3 ? true : false
end

p valid_series?([5, 6, 2, 7, 3, 12, 4, 8])        # should return true
p valid_series?([1, 12, 2, 5, 16, 6])             # should return false
p valid_series?([28, 3, 4, 7, 9, 14])             # should return false
p valid_series?([20, 6, 9, 4, 2, 1, 2, 3])        # should return true
p valid_series?([10, 6, 19, 2, 6, 4])             # should return false

def valid_series?(nums)
  return false if nums.sum != 47

  odd_count = nums.count { |n| n.odd? }
  odd_count == 3 ? true : false
end

p valid_series?([5, 6, 2, 7, 3, 12, 4, 8])        # should return true
p valid_series?([1, 12, 2, 5, 16, 6])             # should return false
p valid_series?([28, 3, 4, 7, 9, 14])             # should return false
p valid_series?([20, 6, 9, 4, 2, 1, 2, 3])        # should return true
p valid_series?([10, 6, 19, 2, 6, 4])             # should return false

Further Exploration
If you take a close look at odd_count == 3 ? true : false, you see that the
equality comparison odd_count == 3 itself returns a Boolean. Is the ternary
operator on line 5 really necessary in order to return a Boolean from
our method?

No. It can be written as below:
=end
def valid_series?(nums)
  return false if nums.sum != 47

  odd_count = nums.count { |n| n.odd? }
  odd_count == 3
end

p valid_series?([5, 6, 2, 7, 3, 12, 4, 8])        # should return true
p valid_series?([1, 12, 2, 5, 16, 6])             # should return false
p valid_series?([28, 3, 4, 7, 9, 14])             # should return false
p valid_series?([20, 6, 9, 4, 2, 1, 2, 3])        # should return true
p valid_series?([10, 6, 19, 2, 6, 4])             # should return false
