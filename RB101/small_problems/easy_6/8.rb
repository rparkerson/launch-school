Find the Duplicate
Given an unordered array and the information that exactly one value in the
array occurs twice (every other value occurs exactly once), how would you
determine which value occurs twice? Write a method that will find and
return the duplicate value that is known to be in the array.

Examples:

find_dup([1, 5, 3, 1]) == 1
find_dup([18,  9, 36, 96, 31, 19, 54, 75, 42, 15,
          38, 25, 97, 92, 46, 69, 91, 59, 53, 27,
          14, 61, 90, 81,  8, 63, 95, 99, 30, 65,
          78, 76, 48, 16, 93, 77, 52, 49, 37, 29,
          89, 10, 84,  1, 47, 68, 12, 33, 86, 60,
          41, 44, 83, 35, 94, 73, 98,  3, 64, 82,
          55, 79, 80, 21, 39, 72, 13, 50,  6, 70,
          85, 87, 51, 17, 66, 20, 28, 26,  2, 22,
          40, 23, 71, 62, 73, 32, 43, 24,  4, 56,
          7,  34, 57, 74, 45, 11, 88, 67,  5, 58]) == 73

P
input: array (unordered)
output: value of duplicate(element)
rules
explicit:
determine what value occurs twice
write a method that ruturns duplicate value
only 1 value is a duplicate
implicit:
question:
What will the elements always be integers? - not indicated

D
array

A
- remove all duplicates
- compare removed array with original and return difference

initialize new array `duplicate`
iterate through array and add each element new array
  check if current element is in new array
  if not append to array
    if is return value
