Let's look at object id's again from the perspective of a method call
instead of a block.

Here we haven't changed ANY of the code outside or inside of the
block/method. We simply took the contents of the block from the previous
practice problem and moved it to a method, to which we are passing all
of our outer variables.

Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the
flow of the code below:

=begin
a_outer is 42 with an id of: 85 before the block.
b_outer is forty two with an id of: 60 before the block.
c_outer is [42] with an id of: 80 before the block.
d_outer is 42 with an id of: 85 before the block.
* Notice that this works the same as before. No big surprise.

a_outer id was 85 before the method and is: 85 inside the method.
b_outer id was 60 before the method and is: 60 inside the method.
c_outer id was 80 before the method and is: 80 inside the method.
d_outer id was 85 before the method and is: 85 inside the method.
* This is also the same as before. These "outers" are NOT the same
  variables as those outside, Ruby is simply re-using the objects,
  as these new variables have the same values as the ones outside.

a_outer inside after reassignment is 22 with an id of: 85 before and: 45 after.
b_outer inside after reassignment is thirty three with an id of: 60 before and: 100 after.
c_outer inside after reassignment is [44] with an id of: 80 before and: 120 after.
d_outer inside after reassignment is 44 with an id of: 85 before and: 89 after.
* As before with the block version of this practice problem, when we change
  the values of our "outers", Ruby uses new objects for these variables to
  deal with their new values.

* One important difference to note is that before, we saw Ruby re-using the
  "42" object and just giving it a new value inside the block.
  Why the difference? It should become clear a couple of paragraphs
  later in this solution...

a_inner is 22 with an id of: 45 inside the method (compared to 45 for outer).
b_inner is thirty three with an id of: 100 inside the method (compared to 100 for outer).
c_inner is [44] with an id of: 120 inside the method (compared to 120 for outer).
d_inner is 44 with an id of: 89 inside the method (compared to 89 for outer).
* No big surprise here...Ruby is re-using objects that have the same values...

a_outer is 42 with an id of: 85 BEFORE and: 85 AFTER the method call.
b_outer is forty two with an id of: 60 BEFORE and: 60 AFTER the method call.
c_outer is [42] with an id of: 80 BEFORE and: 80 AFTER the method call.
d_outer is 42 with an id of: 85 BEFORE and: 85 AFTER the method call.
* Wow, look at that. Even though we changed the values of our "outer"
  variables inside the method call, we still have the same values and
  the same object id's down here AFTER the method call as we had before it!

  This is because our method call accepts VALUES as arguments. The names we
  give to those values in the definition of our method are SEPARATE from
  any other use of those same names.

  We used the same names there for convenience (and admittedly to build
  some suspense and allow us to clarify this point). We could just as
  easily have called the first parameter of our method definition a_Fred
  instead of a_outer.

  The method gets the VALUES of the arguments we pass, but the parameter
  variables inside the method have no other relationship to those outside
  of the method. The names were coincidental, and confusing in a useful way.

  ugh ohhhhh
  ugh ohhhhh
  ugh ohhhhh
  ugh ohhhhh
  * Our main method STILL has no access to variables that are defined
    inside of the method.
    
The diffence from the block is the method invocation did not change the
outer scope object id's when they were reassigned.
